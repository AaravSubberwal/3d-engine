# 3d-engine

So I was looking for fancy programs to write and then I decided to make a circle generator in a terminal. When I finally made it I was inspired and wanted to build something extraordinary. So I though Why not just make a 3d rotating cube in a terminal just like I did with the circle generator earlier. After a few days of work I did pull it off.

The resources I used was mostly this book my dad bought in 1994 called cutting edge 3d game programming with c++ by John De Goes. 

Basically what the program does is it can take input points and it'll put them up on a screen
everywhere there's supposed to be a point a "#" is printed and where there is none it's just "   ". after making a desired image it clears out the terminal and prints it again. In every frame all points are rotatated and then printed.

# Project Roadmap

> *The next step is physics.*
- render a sphere in 3d
- I want to add some sort of lightsource which reflects light on a sphere and this light source is oscilating and it looks amazing
- *A 3d game in which you can walk around using wasd keys*
